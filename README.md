Hi!

I'm an aspiring data engineer from Copenhagen, Denmark. I love to excavate surprising insights hidden "in plain sight" in the data all around us. I'm interested in all types of data but I do have a special fondness for the geographical sort.

Instead of reading a long-winded description, why not just jump right into my projects? Some of them are even quite fun, if I may say so myself, and all of them have a user-friendly description to guide you:

**[Remoteness](https://github.com/JackyVSO/JackyVSO/blob/main/remoteness.md)** - Mapping remoteness in Denmark using address data

**[Magic Data Button](https://github.com/JackyVSO/JackyVSO/blob/main/MagicDataButton.md)** - Scraping and sanitizing data from multiple sources to provide one convenient live overview in MS Excel

**[Population](https://github.com/JackyVSO/JackyVSO/blob/main/population.ipynb)** - Estimating area population using satellite images

**[Starcraft](https://github.com/JackyVSO/Starcraft/blob/main/readme.md)** - Compiling, analyzing and visualizing data from eSports games (go to the [project repository](https://github.com/JackyVSO/Starcraft/tree/main) to browse all files from this project)

**[Truly Random](https://github.com/JackyVSO/JackyVSO/blob/main/TrulyRandom/TrulyRandom.md#how-do-you-generate-a-completely-random-but-fully-coherent-sentence)** - Generating absolutely random but grammatically correct instructions for things to do, word by word

**[Houses](https://github.com/JackyVSO/JackyVSO/blob/main/Houses.ipynb)** - Predicting house sales prices from tabular data with ML
