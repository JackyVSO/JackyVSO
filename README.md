Hi!

I'm an aspiring data engineer from Copenhagen, Denmark. I'll deal with any data you throw at me but I have a special fondness for geographical data.

The other files in the eponymous repository contain descriptions of the projects I've done so far. Feel free to have a snoop around.

**Remoteness** - Mapping remoteness in Denmark using address data

**Population** - Estimating area population using satellite images

**Houses** - Predicting house sales prices from tabular data

**Starcraft** - Compiling, analyzing and visualizing data from eSports games (go to the [project repository](https://github.com/JackyVSO/Starcraft/tree/main) to browse all files from this project)

**Truly Random** - Generating absolutely random instructions word by word (enter folder and open trulyrandom.md for a detailed description)
