Hi!

I'm an aspiring Machine Learning engineer from Copenhagen, Denmark. I'll deal with any data you throw at me but I have a special fondness for geographical data.

The other files in the eponymous repository are the projects I've done so far. Feel free to have a snoop around.


Remoteness - Mapping remoteness in Denmark using address data

Population - Estimating area population using satellite images

Houses - Predicting house sales prices from tabular data

Truly Random - Generating absolutely random instructions word by word (enter folder and open trulyrandom.md for a detailed description)
